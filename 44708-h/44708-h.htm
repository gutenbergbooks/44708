<p class="title1">(<i>A Dramatic Study of Cause and Effect.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Interior of a Private Box at a Popular Theatre.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Angelina</span> <i>and her people</i>.</p>

<p><i>Paterfamilias.</i> Well, now that we are here, I hope you are satisfied.
As for myself, I hate these problem plays.</p>

<p><i>Materfamilias.</i> They are entirely the vogue just now, and we
must see them. What everybody does we must do.</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> So I told <span class="sc">Edwin</span>&mdash;I should say, Mr.
<span class="sc">Domum</span>&mdash;when he
complained of our going.</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> Of course. We have to follow the fashion.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> Hush! You must not talk any more, see the curtain has
risen.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Five minutes pass.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Heroine</i> (<i>on the stage</i>). And so, my dear, my marriage was an
utter failure. The monotony of the life was terrible. My husband
anticipated my every wish. The tameness was too awful for words,
and so I left him.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>Loud applause.</i></p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> (<i>to her husband</i>). Ah, I never left you, <span class="sc">Richard</span>!</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>to his wife</i>). Nor I you, <span class="sc">Bridget</span>!</p>

<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>aside</i>). I suppose married life must be very wearisome.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Ten minutes pass.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Second Heroine</i> (<i>on the stage</i>). And now I will tell you the secret
of my life. I never loved my husband. He gave me all I required&mdash;fine
clothes, sparkling jewels, an opera box. But his presents
were insults in disguise, and I left him.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>Loud applause.</i></p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> I did not insult you by handing you too many gifts,
<span class="sc">Bridget</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> Indeed you did not, <span class="sc">Richard</span>. In fact, I think you carried
your abstention too far.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> Not at all. See, after these many years, we are devoted to
one another!</p>

<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>aside</i>). Failure of Marriage Number Two! Weddings
seem to be mistake!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Two hours pass.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Third Heroine.</i> I tell you, my Lord Bishop, that I have never
regretted leaving you. Twenty years ago you were a young curate,
and you spoilt our married life by your indulgence. You let me have
everything I wanted. No, my Lord, I will hear no more.</p>

<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>aside</i>). Another matrimonial failure! I really must
have a good think over it.</p>

<p><i>Pater.</i> (<i>to</i> Mater.). Well, I hope you are satisfied!</p>

<p><i>Mater.</i> (<i>to</i> Pater.). Awfully depressing, but I don't see what harm
it can do to anyone.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>An hour passes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>writing in her own room</i>). "Dear <span class="sc">Edwin</span>, I call
you by your christian name, for the last time. I can never be yours. I am
convinced from all I have heard that marriage is a failure. Sincerely
yours, <span class="sc">Angelina</span>."</p>

W. Lucy</span> on his delightful
life of Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>

No one certainly has had
better opportunities than
<span class="sc">Toby</span>, M.P., for studying
the great statesman in
all his varying moods;
and it may be affirmed
with equal certainty that
no other man (or dog)
could have used his opportunities
to greater
advantage for the benefit
of the public. There are
in this little volume a
tone of easy yet scholarly
courtesy, a fine literary
touch, and a marvellous
power of condensing
details into one
vividly descriptive sentence.
It is an admirable
piece of work, which,
seeing that it only costs
a shilling, ought to be
sure of a popularity
fully equal to its high
merits.</p>

the
lecturer tells us how he was accompanied in his researches by
Mr. <span class="sc">Grenfell</span>, "The Craven Fellow." How doubly plucky of
Professor <span class="sc">Petrie</span> to proceed with such a companion so extraordinarily
timorous as is expressed in such a <i>sobriquet</i> as "The Craven
Fellow." However, he belied his name by showing such pluck and
perseverance in rendering assistance to the Professor as will entitle
him to explain himself as "<i>Late</i> the Craven Fellow," but <i>now</i> "the

<h3>"STRANGE DISAPPEARANCES."</h3>

<p>The four strangers were gathered together in the all-but-deserted
inn. They were forced to enter into conversation, because the
solitary periodical taken in by the landlord had been read from title
to imprint by everyone of them.</p>

<p>"A strange article," said the first, as he laid down the <cite>Lancet</cite>.
"And so men disappear entirely for awhile, and then come back to
their homes and profession as if nothing had happened."</p>

<p>"Extraordinary," murmured the second. "I see that the scientific
publication you have just relinquished suggests that the cause
of these hurried exits partake of the nature of post-epileptic phenomena."
And then the talk went on. The four strangers dined
together, supped together, and on the following morning partook in
company of breakfast. The waiter, at about eleven o'clock, presented
each of them with a note. It came from the landlord, and was full
of figures. A weird look appeared on their faces.</p>

<p>"We must move on," said one of the quartette; "but as the
staircase is steep, let us descend by the window."</p>

<p>The no-longer-perplexed strangers adopted the suggestion, and
gently sliding down a rope, were soon quit of the inn. They walked
together for about a quarter of a mile, and then coming to four
cross-roads, scattered.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the landlord of the inn, when he once again found
himself alone. "Their disappearance is most strange. I am inclined
to agree with the <cite>Lancet</cite>, 'that the phenomenon remains striking and
mysterious, interesting in its psychological aspect, but in its concrete
form full of practical and medico-legal difficulties;' and, believing
this, I must write to the proper authorities." And he sat down and
composed two letters. One he addressed to the President of the Royal
College of Physicians, and the other to the Editor of <cite>Hue and Cry</cite>.</p>

<p class="title2a"><span class="sc">By Dunno Währiar.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Translated from the original Lappish by Mr. Punch's own Hyperborean
Enthusiast.</i>)</p>

<h3><span class="sc">No. II.&mdash;The Illustrious Stranger.</span></h3>

<p>The sky was darkened by
swart birds, with tufted tails,
and a look in their clay-coloured
eyes as of millions of
stifled croaks; the rain fell in
grizzled sheets like the streaming
hair and beard of some
Titanic lunatic, and the thunder
boomed over the town as if
it had just discovered another
epoch-making novel.</p>

<p>Night fell; I lit my lamp
and closed the shutters, drew
my curtains, so as to shut out
any gleaming cats' eyes that
might be peering at me through
the chinks, and mixed myself
a tumbler of hot punch.</p>

<p>As I finished it, a wild piercing
shriek rose from the universe,
as though someone had
run a pin into the Great Unknown,
and a shining blue-white
ball came down the
chimney and burnt a hole in
the yellow-green gloom of my
hearthrug.</p>

<p>I looked up; a strange man
was sitting right in front of
me. His crested hair had a
blue-white gleam, like the
electric light in a mountain
hotel when the storm is nearly
ended; it stuck out in a spiral
fringe round his cheeks and
chin; his mouth was prim like
a purse; but his spectacles
twinkled with laughter like
the new ferrule on a gingham
umbrella.</p>

<p>"I am the Shaker of Society's
Pillars, I have discovered
that the Tree of Knowledge
of Good and Evil bears
nothing but rotten apples.
There are milestones on the
Bergen road&mdash;but I can see
through most of them. I am the New Generation knocking at the
old stage-door. I am also the
Dramatiser of Social Conundrums
to which there will
never be any answer."</p>

<p>Time passed&mdash;a second or an
hour. I began to wish he
would go.</p>

<p>"I am the great Wizard
that has ennobled and purified
Humanity by showing that
they are all the morbid victims
of a diseased heredity. The
great fire at Christiania was
<i>not</i> the fire in which <i>Mrs. Solness's</i>
nine dolls were burnt.
I am he who has emancipated
Woman by convincing her
that she has the <i>right</i> to be
hysterical."</p>

<p>Again time passed&mdash;an hour
or a second. I fancy I must
have dropped off to sleep.</p>

<span class="sc">Bernick's</span> gander was stolen
by tinkers. I am the original
eld, and also the child who
instructs the grandmotherly
critic in the art of sucking
problematic eggs; but I, too,
am a master-builder of magnificent
bathos."</p>

<p>And again time passed&mdash;a
second or an hour. I wondered
whether he had come to
stay the night.</p>

<p>"Read, I am called 'dramatic';
acted, I am called
'impossible.'"</p>

<p>With that the cock crew.
The stranger had flown before
I had an opportunity of asking
him his name or asking
him to look in again some
evening.</p>

<p>I was rather sorry, for he
seemed to have a flow of agreeable
small talk, though it was perhaps a little egotistic.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> Why did you become a member of a Volunteer corps?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> With the intention of strengthening our national defences.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you think such a proceeding patriotic?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not only patriotic, but necessary.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You probably have some recollection
of the French collapse in 1870-71?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; but I have been chiefly influenced
by considerations of a mathematical
character.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Make your meaning plainer.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I mean that it stands to reason that as
only a small percentage of our people are
trained to arms, and ninety-six per cent of
our neighbours are converted into soldiers,
the latter, in the case of a quarrel with us,
would have the upper hand.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And you think a quarrel entailing the
arbitration of the sword might be sprung
upon us at any moment?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Precisely; that is entirely my opinion.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And, consequently, you take a serious view of Volunteering?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Assuredly, or I would not give up most of my leisure time to
master drill in all its branches.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you obtain any social advantages by wearing the uniform
of a Volunteer?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; on the contrary, the grade of a private in the long run
causes considerable expense; and the commission of an officer is inseparable
from large expenditure and a loss of self-respect.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why is the holding of a commission of a Volunteer officer
"inseparable from a loss of self-respect"?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because, in the general estimation, the holder of a commission
in the Volunteers is worthy of ridicule, pity, or contempt.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can you give the reason for this impression?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is probable that it has been created by the consideration that
a Volunteer officer is chaffed by his friends, sneered at by his enemies,
and mulcted of much money by his comrades.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then a Volunteer officer or private usually joins the force from
the most patriotic of motives?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly. Nine-tenths of the rank and file and their commanding
officers wish to qualify as soldiers capable of repelling a
foreign invasion.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And this being so, they do not wish to spend three or four days
of training in practising "marches past" and other man&oelig;uvres of a
more or less ornamental character?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Quite so; not even when the practice terminates with a review
in a royal park, and a salute performed to the strains of the National
Anthem.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Nor do the Volunteers desire to be made into a raree show?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not even to make a cockney Bank Holiday.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And if you are told that this is the sort of thing that the
Volunteers want, what do you reply?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Nonsense.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And if it were added that more serious work would be unpopular,
what would be your suggestion?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Try and see.</p>

<h3>ROBERT AND THE COUNTY COUNSELLS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Brown</span> and me has been a having sum rare good fun lately. We
has managed to see and hear a good deal about the County Counsellers,
and werry emusing we finds em to be. They suttenly does manage
to quarrell among each other more than I shood have thort posserbel.
There's a depperty Counseller among em who will
tork whenever he gets a hoppertunity, yes and keeps
the pot a biling, as <span class="sc">Brown</span> says, for nearly arf a
nour at a time, and then finds hisself beaten into a
cocked at, and so has to sit down, while the others
has a jolly larf.</p>

<p>Ever so many on em belongs to the Tems Conserwancy,
and so we are offen hearing of their going
up the River, when there's two much water there,
and hoffering to show the poor natives how to get a
lot of it away, but from what I hears they don't
seem for to be werry sucksessful.</p>

<p>Too or three on em went to the Boat Race the other
day and took ever so many Ladies with em, and jolly
nice dinners they had on bord after the Race was over and there wasn't
no more fear of no more rane, which had rayther spylt the morning.</p>

<p>It's reel good fun to hear the Counsellors tork about the Copperation
nowadays! such a difference to what it was about a year ago!
Then it was all bragging and boasting, now it's all begging your
pardon, and arsking your grace, and it shant occur again! I never
thort to see such a change, and it's really werry emusing. The two
places where they speshally seems not at all at their ease are the
Court of Common Counsel and the Manshun House; and in both of
these honnerd places the few as wenters in do look uncumferal
indeed! and the reel natives don't show them no pitty! not a bit of
it, but takes a quiet larf whenever they gits a good chance.</p>

<p>I've herd as one of the Counsellors has been herd to say as there
are no less than three on em in the House of Commons, each of em
quite equal to the late Speaker, if not shuperior to him, and that it
was only beggarly jealousy as prewented them giving them a fare
chance!</p>

<p>The same honorable Gent has been herd to say that the County
Counsellors was much shuperior to the City Copperation, for it was
only last Toosday as they agreed, without a word of remonsterance,
to raise no less than two millions of money from next year's rates!</p>

<h3>A SONG OF SPRING.</h3>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, painters, you who always "come</p>
<p class="i2">Before the swallow dares, and take</p>
<p>The winds of March"&mdash;till May&mdash;with some</p>
<p class="i2">Atrocious smell of paint, and make</p>
<p>The streets in such a shocking state, you</p>
<p>Are quite a nuisance&mdash;how I hate you!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>How can I wear in peace a neat,</p>
<p class="i2">Silk hat, and coat of decent black,</p>
<p>When, passing you in any street,</p>
<p class="i2">Your paint may tumble on my back,</p>
<p>Or I may smash, which might be sadder,</p>
<p>My hat against your sloping ladder?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>How can the spring delight my mind,</p>
<p class="i2">How can I like the budding trees,</p>
<p>The butterflies of any kind?</p>
<p class="i2">A Painted Lady could not please</p>
<p>In any way the mental man,</p>
<p>Were I a painted gentleman.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>How can I like the balmy air,</p>
<p class="i2">How dream of violets in bloom,</p>
<p>When paint-pots swing aloft and scare</p>
<p class="i2">With visions of impending doom?</p>
<p>I'm mad and hot&mdash;quite crimson madder&mdash;</p>
<p>With dodging each successive ladder.</p>

<p class="i2"><i>I</i> can't pretend to indignation.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>To bant from early morn till late</p>
<p class="i2">May be, of course, supremely right of you;</p>
<p>But if you feel oppressed by weight,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Though that I swear I will not do,</p>
<p class="i2">Let others, if they like, make bold to&mdash;</p>

<h2>REFLECTIONS OF A STATESMAN.</h2>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Things looking queer. Leamington in a ferment,
Tories denouncing <i>me</i>. Like their impudence. Must order <span class="sc">Arthur
Balfour</span> to stop this nonsense, and bring rebels to reason. I shall
want Hythe thrown into the bargain. <span class="sc">Balfour</span> must write more
letters. If our little lot are to get
nothing out of all this, what's the use
of having sacrificed principles and
<span class="sc">Courtney</span>? Obviously none. <span class="sc">Jesse
Collings</span> quite agrees. Says the
Tories will repent, when it is too late,
of having refused to submit to the
greatest, wisest, most generous and
noblest statesman of this or any other
age, past or future. Wonderful amount
of sense in <span class="sc">Jesse</span>. Shall make him
Governor-General of India, or First
Lord of Admiralty.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Have seen <span class="sc">Balfour</span>.
Says he can do nothing at Leamington.
Wanted me to withdraw Liberal Unionist candidate.
<span class="sc">Me!</span> The mere notion ridiculous. Told him so. Also asked him
how about Compact. He said "Compact be &mdash;&mdash;". At this moment
<span class="sc">Goschen</span> came in, and interrupted. <span class="sc">Balfour</span> said missing word
was
"observed." <span class="sc">Goschen</span> full of sympathy, but said he could do
nothing. Shall not allow him to be Chancellor of Exchequer again.
Shall be Chancellor of Exchequer myself. Letter in <i>Times</i> from
<span class="sc">Geoffrey Drage</span>, saying kind things about me. Rather patronising,
but well meant. Shall make <span class="sc">Drage</span> Home Secretary.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Letter in <i>Times</i> from Lord <span class="sc">Teynham</span> attacking me
on
account of vote on Welsh Disestablishment. Even a fool of a lord
might know a man can't wriggle out of everything, and can't please
everybody. Have written to <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> ordering him to throw
<span class="sc">Teynham</span> into the Tower as soon as Unionist Government in power.
If he refuses, shall accept Premiership myself and execute <span class="sc">Teynham</span>
on Tower Hill. Leamington still raging. If this goes on shall march
at head of Birmingham Fencibles and rase Leamington to the ground&mdash;all
except three houses said to belong to Liberal Unionists.
That'll teach them to oppose <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Letter in <i>Times</i> from <span class="sc">Byron Reed</span>. Says I'm not
so bad as they want to make me out. Nice sensible fellow <span class="sc">Byron</span>.
Shall make him Minister of Agriculture. Have sent ultimatums to
<span class="sc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="sc">Balfour</span>, <span class="sc">Akers-Douglas</span>, <span class="sc">Michael
Hicks-Beach</span>, and
<span class="sc">Chaplin</span>, ordering them to retire from public life. Shall run the
show on entirely different lines with <span class="sc">Austen</span> and <span class="sc">Jesse</span> to help
me.
Have heard from editor of <i>New Review</i>, who refuses to disclose name
of author, of an attack on me. Have sent <span class="sc">Henry James</span> to editor
with new patent rack and thumbscrews. But there, my name's easy.
Never could bear malice. Always forgive everybody.... Notes
from <span class="sc">Salisbury, Balfour &amp; Co.</span> They refuse to retire. <span class="sc">Henry
James</span> returns. Editor broke rack and threw thumbscrews out of
window. A very rude man, <span class="sc">Henry James</span> says. <span class="sc">Gully</span> elected
Speaker. I'm off to Birmingham.</p>

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><i>Later.</i>&mdash;Letter from <span class="sc">Hart Dyke</span> in the <i>Times</i>. A good
fellow,
<span class="sc">Hart Dyke</span>. But why, in the name of screw-nails, should they all
presume to patronise <i>me?</i></p>

<p class="center">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Letter in <i>Standard</i> from <span class="sc">Stanley Boulter</span>. Must stop that kind
of nonsense. Leading article in <i>Standard</i>. Usual futilities: "We
fully recognise loyal services, but on the present occasion," &amp;c. Shall
refuse peerage and retire to Central Australia with <span class="sc">Jesse</span> to found a
Me-colony. Sick of the whole show.</p>

<p class="ind">QUEER QUERY.&mdash;<span class="sc">Any Advance?</span>&mdash;I see that at the Shop
Assistants' Conference at Cardiff it was said that what shop-workers
ought to go in for was a "Forward Policy." Surely this must be a
mistake? If there is one thing that everybody objects to, it is forward
young men and women behind the counter. One often hears the
shop-walker say, "Will you come forward, Miss <span class="sc">Jones</span>, and serve this
lady!" And perhaps <i>that</i> was what the Cardiff people were thinking
of. Can this be the true explanation? I sincerely hope so; I don't
want a "forward" young person, a sort of "independent labour
party," slamming down goods for <i>me</i> to inspect!&mdash;<span class="sc">Alarmed.</span></p>
